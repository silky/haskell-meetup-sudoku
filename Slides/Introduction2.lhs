Specifically, we will define a function "solve", for computing all the ways a
given grid may be completed. If only one solution is wanted, then we can just
take the head of the list. Lazy-evaluation will ensure that only the first
result will then be computed.

We begin with a specification, then use equational reasining to calculate a more
efficient version. There are no maths involved, just reasoning and logic!
